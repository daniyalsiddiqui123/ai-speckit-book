## Prompt

```text
Building a Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course. Let's use the above dicussion as our specification requirements.
```

## Response snapshot

Specification complete for feature `robotics-textbook`.

- **Branch**: `001-robotics-textbook`
- **Spec File**: `specs/001-robotics-textbook/spec.md`

The specification has been generated and validated against the quality checklist. No clarifications are needed.

The project is ready for the next phase. You can now proceed with `/sp.plan` to create the architectural plan for this feature.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, validated specification for the robotics textbook structure.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 2 files created/modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The process was smooth as the initial user request contained a very detailed structure, removing ambiguity.
