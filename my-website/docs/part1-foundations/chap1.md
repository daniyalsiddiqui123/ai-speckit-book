# Chapter 1: Introduction to Robotics

This chapter provides a foundational understanding of robotics, its historical evolution, and its diverse applications across various industries and domains.

## Key Concepts

### Definition of a Robot
A robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous machine capable of sensing its environment, performing computations to make decisions, and executing physical actions. Robots are typically programmable and can range from simple mechanical arms to complex humanoid systems. The core characteristics often include:
*   **Sensing:** Gathering information about the environment (e.g., cameras, lidar, touch sensors).
*   **Planning/Intelligence:** Processing sensory data, making decisions, and planning actions (often involving AI).
*   **Actuation:** Executing physical movements or manipulations (e.g., motors, grippers).

### History of Robotics
The concept of automatons dates back centuries, but modern robotics began to take shape in the 20th century.
*   **Ancient Roots:** Early concepts of mechanical servants and automatons can be found in Greek mythology and ancient engineering.
*   **Industrial Revolution:** Paved the way for automation and early programmable machines.
*   **20th Century Pioneers:**
    *   **1920s:** Karel Čapek coins the term "robot" in his play *R.U.R.* (Rossum's Universal Robots).
    *   **1940s:** Isaac Asimov formulates the "Three Laws of Robotics."
    *   **1950s:** George Devol invents "Unimate," the first industrial robot. Joseph Engelberger pioneers its commercialization.
    *   **1960s-1970s:** Development of early robotic arms for manufacturing, focus on precision and repeatability.
    *   **1980s-Present:** Explosion in robotic research and applications, including mobile robots, humanoid robots, and the integration of advanced AI.

### Types of Robots
Robots can be categorized based on their structure, mobility, and application.
*   **Industrial Robots:** Robotic arms used in manufacturing for tasks like welding, assembly, painting, and material handling.
*   **Mobile Robots:** Robots capable of moving in their environment, including wheeled, tracked, and legged robots (e.g., AGVs, drones, delivery robots).
*   **Humanoid Robots:** Designed to resemble the human body, often capable of bipedal locomotion and human-like interaction.
*   **Collaborative Robots (Cobots):** Designed to work safely alongside humans in shared workspaces.
*   **Service Robots:** Robots performing tasks for humans in domestic (e.g., robot vacuums), medical (e.g., surgical robots), or public (e.g., 안내 로봇) settings.
*   **Exploration Robots:** Robots designed for hazardous or inaccessible environments, such as space, deep sea, or disaster zones.

### Applications of Robotics
Robotics has a transformative impact across numerous sectors.
*   **Manufacturing:** Automation of production lines, increasing efficiency, precision, and safety.
*   **Healthcare:** Surgical assistance, rehabilitation, drug delivery, telemedicine.
*   **Logistics and Warehousing:** Automated guided vehicles (AGVs), robotic sorting and picking systems.
*   **Exploration:** Space probes, underwater vehicles, hazardous material inspection.
*   **Agriculture:** Automated planting, harvesting, crop monitoring.
*   **Defense and Security:** Surveillance, reconnaissance, bomb disposal.
*   **Education:** Teaching platforms, research tools.
*   **Domestic:** Household chores, entertainment.
