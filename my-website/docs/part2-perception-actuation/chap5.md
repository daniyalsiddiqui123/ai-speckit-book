# Chapter 5: Robot Sensors

This chapter explores the different types of sensors used in robotics for perceiving the environment and the robot's internal state.

## Key Concepts

*   Proprioceptive Sensors (e.g., Encoders, IMUs)
*   Exteroceptive Sensors (e.g., Cameras, Lidar, Ultrasonic)
*   Sensor Fusion
*   Sensor Noise and Calibration

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Identify and classify various robot sensors.
*   Understand the working principles of common sensors.
*   Explain the concept of sensor fusion.
*   Address challenges related to sensor noise and calibration.
