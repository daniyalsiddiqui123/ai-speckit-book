# Chapter 9: Robot Planning and Navigation

Robot planning and navigation are critical aspects of intelligent robotics, enabling robots to move from one point to another in an environment while avoiding obstacles and achieving specific goals. This involves understanding the environment, determining a path, and executing that path.

## Key Concepts

### Motion Planning
Motion planning is the process of finding a sequence of valid configurations that moves a robot from a start configuration to a goal configuration. It typically involves geometric path planning (finding a collision-free path) and trajectory generation (adding time information to the path).

*   **Path Planning:**
    *   **Configuration Space (C-space):** A higher-dimensional space where each point represents a unique configuration of the robot (e.g., joint angles for a manipulator, position and orientation for a mobile robot). Obstacles in the workspace map to "C-obstacles" in C-space.
    *   **Graph-based Planners:**
        *   **Dijkstra's Algorithm / A* Algorithm:** Search algorithms that find the shortest path on a discrete graph.
    *   **Sampling-based Planners:**
        *   **Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT/RRT*):** Explore the C-space by randomly sampling configurations and connecting them to a tree structure. Efficient for high-dimensional spaces.
        *   **Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM):** Build a roadmap of possible paths by connecting randomly sampled collision-free configurations.
*   **Trajectory Generation:** Once a path is found, a trajectory is generated by assigning velocities and accelerations to each point on the path, ensuring smooth and dynamically feasible motion within the robot's physical limits.

### Localization
Localization is the process of determining a robot's position and orientation (pose) within a given map. Accurate localization is fundamental for effective navigation and task execution.

*   **Global Positioning System (GPS):** Provides absolute position coordinates in outdoor environments, but often lacks the precision needed for robotics and is unavailable indoors.
*   **Odometry:** Estimates position by integrating wheel rotations (for wheeled robots) or joint movements (for legged robots).
    *   **Advantages:** Relatively simple, high update rate.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Accumulates error over time due to wheel slip, sensor noise, etc.
*   **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):** Builds a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously localizing the robot within that map (covered in more detail in Chapter 6 for Visual SLAM).
*   **Beacon-based Localization:** Uses fixed beacons (e.g., Wi-Fi, UWB, RFID) in the environment to determine the robot's position.
*   **Probabilistic Localization:** Uses Bayesian filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman filters, Particle filters) to estimate the robot's pose based on sensor measurements and a motion model.

### Mapping
Mapping is the process of creating a representation of the robot's environment. The type of map depends on the robot's sensors and the planning algorithms used.

*   **Occupancy Grid Maps:** Represent the environment as a grid, where each cell contains a probability of being occupied by an obstacle.
*   **Feature Maps:** Represent the environment using a set of distinct features (e.g., corners, lines, landmarks).
*   **Topological Maps:** Represent the environment as a graph, where nodes are significant locations and edges are paths connecting them.
*   **3D Point Clouds:** High-fidelity representations created by lidar or RGB-D cameras.

### Collision Avoidance
Collision avoidance ensures that the robot does not collide with obstacles (static or dynamic) in its environment during motion execution. This can be integrated into motion planning or implemented as a reactive control layer.

*   **Static Obstacles:** Known obstacles in the map are avoided by planning collision-free paths.
*   **Dynamic Obstacles:** Unforeseen or moving obstacles require real-time detection (using sensors) and reactive adjustments to the robot's trajectory.
    *   **Methods:** Potential fields, Artificial Potential Fields (APF), Dynamic Window Approach (DWA).

### Navigation Architectures
Navigation architectures define how the different components of a robot's navigation system (sensing, localization, mapping, planning, control) are organized and interact.

*   **Deliberative Architectures:** Emphasize planning, often involving complex AI algorithms to create detailed plans before execution. Slow but robust for complex tasks.
*   **Reactive Architectures:** Prioritize immediate responses to sensor data, often using simple rules to avoid obstacles. Fast but limited in long-term planning.
*   **Hybrid Architectures:** Combine deliberative and reactive elements, using a deliberative layer for high-level planning and a reactive layer for immediate obstacle avoidance and low-level control. This is common in many modern robotic systems.
