# Implementation Plan: Robotics Textbook Structure

**Branch**: `001-robotics-textbook` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-robotics-textbook/spec.md`

## Summary

The project is to create a comprehensive, web-based textbook for a "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course. The textbook will be built as a static site using the Docusaurus framework, with all content managed as code (Markdown/MDX) within a Git repository. The plan prioritizes a structured, maintainable, and high-quality content delivery system that adheres to a strict 6-month timeline.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (for Docusaurus), Python 3.9+ (for code examples)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React, Node.js (for tooling), PyTorch, ROS 2 (for examples)
**Storage**: N/A (Content is stored in `.md` files in the Git repository)
**Testing**: Jest/Vitest (with TypeScript support for custom React components), `markdown-lint`, custom Python scripts (for testing code examples)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Web Application (Static Content Site)
**Performance Goals**: p99 page load time < 2 seconds.
**Constraints**: Project must be completed within a 6-month timeline. Interactive components must be simple visual aids, not complex simulations.
**Scale/Scope**: 14-16 chapters, each with 3-5 sections.

## Key Decisions & Rationale

1.  **Architecture: Content-as-Code with Static Site Generation (SSG)**
    *   **Decision**: All textbook content will be written in Markdown/MDX and managed in a Git repository. The final textbook will be a static website generated by Docusaurus.
    *   **Rationale**: This approach provides version control, enables collaboration, and allows for automated quality checks (linting, testing). Docusaurus is optimized for performance, scalability, and maintainability of documentation-style websites, aligning perfectly with the project's non-functional requirements.

2.  **Code Examples: Loosely Coupled**
    *   **Decision**: Practical code examples will be written as standalone, library-standard Python scripts. The textbook will provide separate textual guidance on how to run these scripts within a recommended simulation environment.
    *   **Rationale**: As per the spec clarification, this makes the content more resilient to changes in simulation technology and more broadly applicable for students using different setups.

3.  **Deployment: CI/CD Automation**
    *   **Decision**: A continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be set up using GitHub Actions.
    *   **Rationale**: On every merge to the `main` branch, the pipeline will automatically build the Docusaurus site, run checks, and deploy the static files to a hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel). This eliminates manual deployment steps and ensures the live textbook is always up-to-date.

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Content Creation Delay** | High | Create a detailed chapter-by-chapter writing schedule with weekly milestones. Use parallel workflows for writing, tech review, and copy-editing. |
| **Scope Creep on Visual Aids** | Medium | Adhere strictly to the clarified definition of "Simple Visual Aids." A template for visual aids will be created, and any component exceeding this template requires formal sign-off. |
| **Inconsistent Content Quality** | Medium | Enforce a mandatory style guide for writing tone and code formatting. Implement automated Markdown and code linters in the CI/CD pipeline to catch violations early. |

└── tasks.md             # To be created by /sp.tasks
```

### Source Code (repository root)

The project will follow a standard Docusaurus v3 project structure.

```text

│   ├── css/
│   └── pages/
├── static/
│   └── img/
├── docusaurus.config.js
└── package.json
```

**Structure Decision**: A standard Docusaurus project structure will be used. The core textbook content will live in the `docs/` directory, organized by the 4-part structure defined in the specification. Custom React components for visual aids will be placed in `src/components/`.

## Evaluation and Validation (Definition of Done)

The project will be considered complete when:
1.  All 14-16 chapters are written, technically reviewed, and copy-edited.
2.  All content is correctly rendered in the deployed Docusaurus site.
3.  The CI/CD pipeline is fully operational.
4.  The deployed site meets all specified Non-Functional Requirements (Accessibility, Performance, Responsiveness).
5.  Success Criterion `SC-005` is met through user acceptance testing with a sample chapter.
